Write `debugger;` into that part of program/project which we want to **debug**. That `debugger;` will work as breakpoint.\r\n2. To run our **NodeJS** application into **debug** mode, type `node debug` command and this command must be followed by our main **JavaScript/.js** file. For this blog we are using **app.js** as main **JavaScript** file, so while running the **app.js** file into **debug** mode, we have to type/run below command into location where **app.js**(main) **JavaScript** file is located:\r\n   * `node debug app.js`\r\n3. To play with **debugger**, we need to know about below 4 operators:\r\n   1. **cont:** It is used to continue/move to next breakpoint/debugger of the program.\r\n   2. **next:** It is used to move to next statement/line of the code/program.\r\n   3. **repl:** It is used to evaluate the code.\r\n   4. **quit:** It is used to quit from the debugging the program.\r\n   5. **help:** It is used to see other commands.\r\n   \r\nEnough for theory part. Let's **debug** a simple program:\r\n\r\nOpen your favourite editor, and copy paste below code in that, then save it as **app.js**.\r\n\r\n**[app.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmitThakkar/Debugging-NodeJS-Application/master/app.js)**\r\n```JavaScript\r\n/**\r\n * Created by Amit Thakkar on 6/11/14.\r\n */\r\nconsole.log(\"Program starting...\");\r\nvar one = 1, two = 2;\r\nvar user = {\r\n  name: \"Amit Thakkar\",\r\n  age: 20\r\n};\r\nuser.age += one++ + ++two + ++one;\r\ndebugger;\r\nuser.age -= one-- - --two - --one;\r\ndebugger;\r\nconsole.log(\"My Name is\", user.name, \"and Age is\", user.age);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor **debugging** `app.js` lets follow all above 3 steps:\r\n\r\n1. **Add `debugger;` into the code**: After looking at the `app.js` code, we know that we have placed only 2 `debugger`/`breakpoint` into the above code, that is on line no. **11 and 13**.\r\n2. **Run `NodeJS` in `debug` mode**: Type and run `node debug app.js`.\r\n3. **Play with `debugger`**: Lets use **cont**, **next**, **repl** and **quit** as below:\r\n\r\n![debugging](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmitThakkar/Debugging-NodeJS-Application/master/debugging.png)\r\n\r\nFollow Me\r\n---\r\n[Github](https://github.com/AmitThakkar)\r\n\r\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/amit_thakkar01)\r\n\r\n[LinkedIn](https://in.linkedin.com/in/amitthakkar01)\r\n\r\n[More Blogs By Me](https://amitthakkar.github.io/)",
